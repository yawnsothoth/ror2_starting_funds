# Starting Funds

This mod adds additional starting funds for the first stage when starting a new run. This is intended to cut down the waiting around at the very start.

The total funds when starting a new game are dependent upon the selected difficulty.

Drizzle starts with 90.
Rainstorm starts with 52.
Monsoon starts with 40.
